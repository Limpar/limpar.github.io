Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. Two species of elephant, the Asian elephant and African elephant, remain extant.
Elephants are herbivores and prefer habitats that give them access to food and water. Both species consume as many as 300 pounds of food per day. Despite obvious similarities, there are key physical differences between Asian and African elephants that distinguish them from each other.</p>
